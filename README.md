# Design Patterns Samples For Python

## TODO:

- [x] Singleton Pattern: Ensure that a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.
- [x] Factory Method Pattern:Define an interface for creating an object but let subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
- [x] Observer Pattern: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- [x] Decorator Pattern: Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
